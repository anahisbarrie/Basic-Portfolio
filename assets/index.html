          <p>I am a creative Industrial Engineer passionated about transforming daily ideas into real facts. In my professional career, either I’m working for a company or I’m hiring, I believe only in one word: *Results* 
            My latest project is an Uber type software application that connects busy dog owners with our affiliates around the area. We have a red of 500+ certified affiliates helping provide an amazing service. I believe technology combined with a good management technique is the future of the world, that's why I am always learning about the newest softwares to be competitive in the industry. My three picked words are: perseverance, responsibility and proven results.
